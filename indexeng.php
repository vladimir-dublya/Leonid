					MEASURING AND ACCOUNTING THE QUANTITY OF LIQUID IN TANKS
				</h2>
			</div>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of accounting for liquids in tanks is of great technological and
				economic importance in various sectors of the economy: the production and storage of petroleum products,
				oils, alcohol, vegetable oils, etc. The solution of these issues allows, in addition to the technical
				tasks of receiving and issuing products, to practically eliminate the influence of the "human factor"
				which provides a quick return on costs for the installation of the system. In addition, for light oil
				products, the installation of such automatic systems is provided for by the Tax Code of Ukraine, while
				the filling is recorded in units reduced to 15 degrees of volume with automatic data transfer to the SFS
				server. Compliance with these requirements requires measuring not only the level of oil products, but
				also density, as well as temperature, taking into account the requirements for the accuracy of
				measurements. Also, the equipment and software used must be entered into the Register of Measuring
				Instruments of Ukraine. <br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the automatic production of these measurements, we have developed and are
				producing a level-density meter of the IPZh series, which operates as part of the “Dnipro-01” system,
				which provides the following measurement accuracy indicators: <br>
				<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;level&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					± 1 mm<br></b>
				<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temperature&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;±
					0,5 &#176;С<br></b>
				<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;density&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;±
					0.5 g/l<br></b>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the accuracy of measuring the level of liquids in our system
				is 2 times higher than the requirements of the Instruction. Another feature of the system is that the
				density measurement takes place at any programmed number of points in the liquid column, regardless of
				the level, which significantly increases the measurement accuracy. The device has an explosion-proof
				design. <br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a modification of the device for working with aggressive liquids,
				for example, aniline, KMTA, etc. <br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When working with viscous liquids (oil, fuel oil, tar, vegetable oils, etc.), our
				system measures the level, subsurface density and temperature, which is used to adjust the density. To
				determine the average density and produced water of such liquids, pressure sensors can be included in
				the system.

				weighing equipment for the enterprises of the oil and fat industry. Our systems are installed at
				flagship enterprises: Zaporizhzhya MZhK, Volnyanskiy MEZ, etc.</p>
