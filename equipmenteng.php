				System composition: <br>
				<b>● PC with specialized software, connected with all elements of the system. <br>
					● level-density meters IPZh-18. <br>
					● control units for level-density meters. <br>
					● controller for control of loading risers into tank trucks (fuel dispensers for
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gas station). <br>
					● specialized cash register. <br>
					● scales carriage electronic RD-150 for acceptance and delivery of oil products <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; by
					railway <br>
					● VA-60E "Dnipro-01" system is the only automatic measurement system that allows to fully comply
					with the requirements of "Instructions on the procedure for receiving, transporting, saving,
					supplying and accounting for oil and oil products at enterprises and organizations of Ukraine"
					(approved on 20.05.2008 This instruction requires measuring the level (accuracy + 1mm), temperature
					(accuracy + 0.5 C), density (accuracy + 0.5 g / l), and the density must be measured at least at 3
					points in the fuel column. </b>
				<br>
				The system produces and dispenses fuel regardless of its level through the fuel dispenser (auto-filling
				risers), taking into account the dynamics of fuel movement in the tanks, both in liters and in
				kilograms. Its application allows you to minimize losses, increase the environmental safety of the
				facility.

				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<img src="images/r2equip.jpg" width="277" height="260" class="leftimg">
				The principle of operation of the level-density meter: <br>
				weighing a control buoy suspended on a stainless steel cable and moved by a servo drive to any point in
				the fuel column on an electronic load balance. The servo drive is absent in the level indicator SU3.
				<br>
				Main technical characteristics: <br>
				<b>● accuracy of measuring the level of fuel and produced water - + 1 mm. <br>
					● range - 0.3 - 18 meters. <br>
					● accuracy of fuel density measurement over the entire height of the tank with automatic step change
					- + 0.5 g / l. <br>
					● accuracy of fuel temperature measurement +0.5 С. <br>
					● the accuracy of the SU3 + level signaling device is 5 mm. <br>
					● special explosion-proof version 0ExSIIT5. </b><br>
				<br>
				The level-density meter works as part of a computer control and accounting system for oil depots and gas
				stations "Dnipro-ITF".
				The program can support any number of density meters.

						Connecting them to a PC. The delivery of raw materials (seeds) for processing is carried out
						through two types of DN-500, which are reconstructed into electronic ones by installing a
						weighing hopper on strain gauges of the PMP-0.5 type and connecting them to an electronic unit
						connected to a PC. The accounting of the three types of produced oil dispensed to the oil
						storage is carried out on six electronic scales operating in pairs. The accounting of the
						produced meal dispensed to the elevator is carried out on two electronic scales operating in
						pairs.

						The scales control panels are connected to the PC. Accounting for the amount of oil in the oil
						storage tanks is carried out using an IPZh-18 level gauge and a PC. Through the scales (7 pcs.),
						Similar to the oil metering scales in the oil extraction shop, the oil is supplied to the
						margarine shop. Dosing of margarine ingredients is carried out in multicomponent electronic
						weighing dosing devices for fat and water-milk phases to obtain margarine emulsion for Johnson
						and Roberts lines. The dispensers are connected to a PC. Packing of liquid margarine is carried
						out in boxes of 20 kg. The filling machine is connected to a PC. Accuracy class of all listed
						scales is 0.1. All scales are connected to a PC, in which data is accumulated and the balance of
						raw materials and products is brought together.
