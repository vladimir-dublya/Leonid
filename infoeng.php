				The tab "RESERVOIR FACTORY" allows you to see the general condition of the tank farm (up to 50 tanks).
				The right side of the panel displays the current characteristics of the tank of interest (fuel level,
				volume and mass, reduced to 20 degrees, the volume and mass of fuel, bottom and subsurface density and
				percentage of filling by level), which is selected by clicking the mouse. When the level is unstable,
				the direction is indicated (by the corresponding pointer - an arrow) and the rate of its change. For a
				tank where the product level has reached the upper warning (limit) level or the lower warning (limit)
				level, a visual and acoustic warning is issued.

					the maximum volume of the tank) - a parameter for making a decision on the alarm in the security
					mode<br></b>
				<br>
				Parameter 2 can be set for each tank separately using the menu "Settings" - "Tanks ..." in the far right
				column.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/info/22.jpg" alt="img" width="850" height="334" /></p>
			<p>Parameter 3, 4 can be set for the entire tank farm using the menu "Settings" - "Technical parameters ..."
				in the windows "Limit value ALPHA (l / h)" and "% of max V for monitoring in security mode (%)"
				respectively. </p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/info/23.jpg" alt="img" /></p>
			<p>You can set the guard mode for the entire tank farm and for individual tanks. <br>
				<b>1.To set the entire tank farm to security mode, use the "Settings" - "Set to security mode" menu. All
					active tanks in the level measurement mode, equipped with a thermal thermosensor and the density
					measurement in which was made no more than an hour ago, will be set to security mode. <br>
					2.To set a separate tank to security mode, use the "Set to security mode" context menu by selecting
					the appropriate tank on the "RESERVOIR PARK" tab.
			</p></b>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/info/24.jpg" alt="img" /></p>
			<p>Tank designation is highlighted in yellow on a green background in the upper left corner of the tank.
				When the radio button "alfa" is selected in the upper right part of the tab "RESERVOIR PARK" on the
				panel with radio buttons, the current value of the speed "alfa" is indicated in the lower left corner of
				each tank. Once the tank is set to guard mode, no decisions are made during one analysis period "alfa"
				(dataset).

				At the end of the data collection when the speed "alfa" is exceeded the critical value or when the
				difference between the volume of fuel reduced to 20оС at time t and the volume of fuel reduced to 20оС
				at the time the tank is set to security mode is exceeded, a decision on ALARM is made. Alarm in security
				mode is accompanied by visual and audible signaling. Tanks in alarm are marked with the following
				symbol: </p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/info/25.jpg" alt="img" /></p>

			</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/info/26.jpg" alt="img" /></p>
			<p>When the parameters are returned outside the permissible values, the visual and audible signaling stops.
				You can view the events that took place in the tank farm using the "VIEW" - "View events ..." menu. To
				view the volume of fuel and the volume of fuel in the tank reduced to 20оС for the selected period of
				time, you can use the "View volume changes" context menu by selecting the appropriate tank on the
				"RESERVOIR FACTORY" tab. </p>
			<p id="info">Work in conditions of negative temperatures.</p>
			<p>When working in the winter season, in tanks with summer diesel fuel or heating oil, a situation may arise
				in which paraffin adheres to the displacer in the tank. In this case, the density meter will experience
				some measurement problems. To avoid this situation, it is necessary to set in the parameters of the
				tanks the temperature that is critical for this type of fuel. </p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/info/27.jpg" alt="img" /></p>
			<p>In this case, if the temperature in the tank has become lower than specified in the parameters, the level
				of the density meter will measure: <br>
				<b>1. Only level.<br>
					2. Only subsurface density and level.<br></b>
				The displacer will not go down to the bottom of the tank, to the frozen paraffin. For all other tanks,
				melting t is not required. The parameters are configured in the Settings - Tech. Parameters - Tab
				"Parameters2".
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/info/28.jpg" alt="img" /></p>
			<p id="info">Work in metrological mode. </p>
			<p>After testing all the components of the computer, the level meter program is automatically launched. The
				displacer will move up to the stop and will wait for the operator's command to measure the level. </p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/info/29.jpg" alt="img" /></p>
			<p>After pressing the button "Level measurement", the program will offer to enter the height of the tank,
				previously measured manually by the lot. Enter the required tank height + 250 mm. For example: the
				height of the tank, measured manually from the bottom to the flange of the IPZH sensor or to the gauge
				hatch (one of the options for installing the IPZH sensor), is equal to 3500 mm. The program must be
				entered - 3500 +250 = 3750 mm. </p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/info/30.jpg" alt="img" /></p>
			<p>After measuring the level, the level gauge must be calibrated according to the readings of the manual
				measurement. To do this, measure the liquid level from the bottom with a lot and enter it (in mm) in the
				“Settings” tab.</p>
